# ahuoiza-baiye-project-3
Website for "which viral meme are you" quiz

This project was built with JavaScript (and a little jQuery). The app takes in user input in the form of radio buttons to determine which of three videos is displayed on the screen upon the click of the "submit" button.

Currently under development:
- Improvements to accessibility for keyboard-only users
- ~Redesign of mobile view (particularly the small font size)~
- ~Apply functional CSS~
- remove scroll (on submit, skip to results section)
- option to retake quiz OR hide questions
